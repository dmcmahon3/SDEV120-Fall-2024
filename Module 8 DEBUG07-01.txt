// Each time a salesperson sells a car at the
// Pardeeville New and Used Auto Dealership,
// a record is created containing the salesperson�s
// name and the amount of the sale.
// Sales of new and used cars are kept in separate files,
// sorted by salesperson ID number.
// Management has requested a merged file so that
// all of a salesperson�s sales (both new and used cars)
// are displayed together. The following code is intended
// to merge the files.

// BUGS FOUND
// Line 36: Changed usedSalesperson to newSalesperson prevent EOF test of wrong file
// Line 23: Changed control variable operator from = to <> 
//            (was inverted for loop to continue properly)
// Line 52: Changed all "new" variables to "used" to check the correct EOF 
//            on line 53 and to prep for the next line 50 new>used test.
// Line 58: Changed all "used" variables to "new" for the same reasons as above.
